        <h1>So lets get Started</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 cup dry basmati rice</li>
            <li>1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups water</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the oil in a medium size saucepan over a medium-high heat. </li>
            <li>Drop in the cumin seeds, and cook until they splutter. Do not allow the cumin seeds to burn or become really dark brown in color.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and fry it in the oil for about 1 minute.</li>    
            <li>Add the water and salt and bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Cook the rice for approximately 15 minutes. If you feel the rice is getting burnt near the base of the pan as it cooks, one trick is to place the saucepan on another flat pan or griddle which is directly on the flame.</li>
            <li>Toss it with a fork</li>
        </ul>
